This repository contains the files that make up the assignment(s) for concepts of programming languages.
The program works as intended
There are no known deviations to the assignment
The program works by first tokenizing the input, where the input is split up into variables, which are strings of letters and numbers that start with a number, 
opening parentheses, closing parentheses, whitespace and lambdas (or backslashes). The tokens and corresponding characters are then put into a vector that 
the parser moves through.
After tokenizing the input goes through the parser, where if statements guide each element through the functions, which are recursive functions that
correspond to the LL grammar of lambda calculus. As the program moves through these functions, accepted input is added to a string, until either the whole
input is accepted, in which case the program exits with exit status 0 and prints said string, 
or the input contains a syntax error in which case the input is erased from the string and the program exits with exit status 1 and an error message.
